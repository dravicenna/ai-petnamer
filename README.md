Generate unique names for your furry friend!

Please provide some information about your pet:
- Pet type (e.g. dog, cat, rabbit)
- Gender (e.g. male, female, gender-neutral)
- Origin (e.g. English, African etc.)
- Color (e.g. black, white, brown)
- Personality traits (e.g. playful, shy, adventurous)

Based on this information, our AI-powered pet name generator will suggest 10 unique and fitting names for your pet.

# Description
Our web app is built using Django and Bootstrap. We have integrated OpenAI's GPT-3 model API into our app to generate unique and fitting names for your pet based on their characteristics.

To deploy the app, we have used Heroku, a cloud-based platform that allows for easy deployment and scaling of web applications.

We have also used Docker Compose to containerize the app, making it easy to deploy the app on any platform. The app code is available on GitHub, allowing you to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
